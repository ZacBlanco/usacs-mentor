# USACS Mentor Lessons

This repository contains some code and mini-lessons on good software engineering practice and other general software development principles that I covered with my USACS mentees in the 2016-2017 academic year.


Each folder in the root of the repository contains a new lesson and has a README which will describe code and any other content present for the lesson.
